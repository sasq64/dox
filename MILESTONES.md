## Milestone 1

* Being able to convert a text document to a target document
* Finding and excluding escaped sections
* Running any lua code found in escaped section
* Implement `print()` that puts text into the target document

## Milestone 2

* Being able to correctly parse a c++ source file using
  the lua `source(fileName)`, probably relying on
  `compile_commands.json`
* Being able to lookup an symbol in the source using
  `symbol()`
